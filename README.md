## Usage

### Conditions
**Conditional Visibility** works by adding new conditions to the conditions panel, for Invisible, Obscured, and In Magical Darkness    
![Conditions Panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gludington/conditional-visibility/master/src/support/conditions.png)

When a token has one of these conditions, it can only be seen by a token with the proper senses configured in their Vision panel
